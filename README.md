# Matrix Operations Program

This Python program allows you to perform various matrix operations using the `numpy` library. It takes user input for two matrices and performs operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, transposition, and trace calculation. The program runs interactively in a loop, allowing the user to choose different operations until they decide to exit.

## Features

- **Matrix Addition**: Adds two matrices element-wise.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices (if dimensions are compatible).
- **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another element-wise.
- **Matrix Division**: Divides two matrices element-wise.
- **Matrix Transpose**: Transposes each of the input matrices.
- **Matrix Trace**: Calculates the trace (sum of the diagonal elements) for each matrix.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` library

You can install the required library with:
```bash
pip install numpy
